Notes:
Only tested with gromacs (5.0.4 and 4.6.7)

please familiarize yourself with plumed2 if you are not already.

Installation:

Make sure you have a copy of PLUMED2 and your favorite (compatiable) MD framework on your system, and they are patched, compiled and linked.

copy MEPRDC.cpp to your <PLUMED2>/src/colvar/-folder

recompile plumed2. recompile your md-framework.

use:

setup and prepare your MD simulation as you would normally.

create a plumed.dat file. using the MEPRDC collective varible and a restraint with slope 1:

example with five RDC restraints none of which are kept aside in a test-set:

--START-plumed.dat--

MEPRDC ...
ATOMS1=37,38 COUPLING1=13.8 TESTSET1=0
ATOMS2=58,59 COUPLING2=11.6 TESTSET2=0
ATOMS3=80,81 COUPLING3=-1.5 TESTSET3=0
ATOMS4=99,100 COUPLING4=7.6 TESTSET4=0
ATOMS5=115,116 COUPLING5=-4.8 TESTSET5=0
WRITE_RDC
OUTPUT_PREFIX=MEPOUTPUT
DMAXS=50
DT=0.0001
NAVERAGE=50
NAVEPS=100
SEED=24
LABEL=nh
... MEPRDC
rdce: RESTRAINT ARG=nh KAPPA=0. SLOPE=1.0 AT=0

--END-plumed.dat--

THE ATOM/COUPLING/TESTSET lines specifies the experimental RDC values between atom pairs and a flag whether they are used for estimation (0) or kept aside for (1) for computing a Qfree.
WRITE_RDC is a flag which determines if predicted RDCs and Lagrange multipliers (Lambda) are outputted to a file (with prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX) for every estimationstep.
DMAXS specifies the initial value f the product between Dmax and s (the degree of alignment)
DT is the \Delta t 'learning rate' or step-size in Lagrange space during estimation.
NAVERAGE specifies how many MD/MC steps inbetween saving statistics for estimation of the parameters s and Lambda
NAVEPS specifies how many counts of the used pr MPI process pr estimation step
SEED is the random seed for the pseudo random number engine (mersenne twister if compiled with boost) if multiple MPI proceess are run the seed will be: SEED+mpi_rank.
LABEL is used to name the restrain instance.
if GROMACS is being used the ATOMS, COUPLING, TESTSET lines can be generated from a toplogy and a RDC-table format file using the supplied python script: make_plumed_rdc.py.

start md with plumed.dat as input. for gromacs this is done by using the -plumed argument, for mdrun.

if data from multiple alignment media is available simply create a restraint and MEPRDC instance for each dataset in the same file (with different labels) and run as above
